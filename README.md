In this project, I will show different processes a dataset can go through, from webscraping unstructured data - leading up to the creation of an interactive dashboard for stakeholders, personal use, ect. 

Each process seperated into their own files; I show the source code taken to **webscrape**(utilized Wikipedia in this specific project), **wrangle, mine (eda & visualizations), and model data** (predicting whether a launch will be successful or not, based on different independent variables) using simple ML algorithms.
